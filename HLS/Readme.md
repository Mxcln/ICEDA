# HLS

This is one of the ICEDA class projects. The project is about the High Level Synthesis (HLS) of a simple image processing algorithm.


## Developing Note
* All the definition of basic class are in the `Basic.hpp` file.
* The `run`function in `HLSHandler` class is the entry of the HLS process.
* Put the utility function in `util.h/cpp` file in order to make the code clean and reusable.
